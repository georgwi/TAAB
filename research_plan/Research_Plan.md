## General Introduction

We think ants are exciting animals because – despite their small body mass and therefore small brain – they form very huge and complex social structures. Very large numbers of them work together efficently like one body. This requires a high level of coordination. We have already seen some videos which show the great achievngs of ant colonies in building and hunting. Now we found out about their naviagion abilities and are curious to learn how ants are able to cover extreme (in comparison to their own body size) distances. The human being would definitely get lost when trying to jurney this far in the desert wthout GPS or any other form of modern help, so one of our main goals will be to find out how ants can master this difficult task.

Ants have been subject of modern research since 1848, the motivations were often interest in their instincts, society and of couse the hope to learn from them. Studies in ant movement became even more compelling when scientists started to look for algorithms that solve such fundamental tasks like finding the shortest way in a graph (Graph Theorie). The class of ant colony optimization algorithms was introduced 1992 and has since been a field of active study.
## Fundamental Questions

- How does ant movement and navigation work in challenging environments such as the desert?
  - Is ant communication connected to ant navigation?
  - Which mechanisms and factors influence ant movement?
  - Are there different strategies to find the shortest/safest etc. path?
- How can we describe ant paths in mathematical terms?
  - How efficient are our mathematical models of the real ant behaviour?
- How does our finding apply to the real world?

We would like to create a model of desert ant behaviour. This will include their search for food, their returning to the nest and their orientation with global and local vectors. Also we will see how close our algorithms are to real ant movement. Therefore we want to simulate the experiments described in the papers. Our model should be able to deal with different numbers of landmarks, obstacles and starting points. We would like to give our ants the ability to learn and improve their efficency when searching and finding food. Of course there will be some simplifications we eventually will have to deal with: Such as ... will be updated during work on the simulation.

## Expected Results

We expect to find out, that ants have a very optimized way to orientate because they have evolved since a very long time and conquered nearly every possible territory on the earth. The evolution may have taught them lots of useful tricks and methods to survive in environmets like the desert. Probably there are more ways to orientate than only by landmarks. Ants may have similar ways to find out their geographic orientation like pigeons, or use the sun as a fix-point. We are curious to find out more about that.

Of course we hope that there are already some good mathematical models available on ant movement, because these animals are topic of research for a long time already.
